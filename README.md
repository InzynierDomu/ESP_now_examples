## Examples list
### Framework Arduino
* get_mac - To pair boards and send messages to specific boards, you will need the MAC addresses of this boards.
#### ESP8266
* point-point_sender - send message via esp now to reciver
* point-point_receiver - receive message via esp now
* Central - reads rfid tag, sends message to specific boards ESP32/slave example, receives temperature measurements and displays them
* Central_broadcast - reads rfid tag, sends broadcast message(to all), receives temperature measurements and displays them
* Central_to_server - reads rfid tag, message to specific boards ESP32/web_server example
#### ESP32
* point-point_sender - send message via esp now to reciver
* point-point_receiver - receive message via esp now
* slave - Receives a message from the ESP8266/Central and replies with a temperature measurement
* web_server - Receives a message from the ESP8266/Central and shows incoming rfid code on web server
#### Wrapper
Versions with a wrapper that works for both ESP8266 and ESP32
* point-point_sender - send message via esp now to reciver
* point-point_receiver - receive message via esp now
### ESP IDF
